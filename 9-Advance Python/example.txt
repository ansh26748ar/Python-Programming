Sorbitol may be synthesised via a glucose reduction reaction[7] in which the converted aldehyde group is converted into a hydroxyl group. 

The reaction requires NADH and is catalyzed by aldose reductase.

Glucose reduction is the first step of the polyol pathway of glucose metabolism, 
and is implicated in multiple diabetic complications.

C6H12O6 + NADH + H+ â†’ C6H14O6 + NAD+

The mechanism involves a tyrosine residue in the active site of aldehyde reductase. 
The hydrogen atom on NADH is transferred to the electrophilic aldehyde carbon atom; 
electrons on the aldehyde carbon-oxygen double bond are transferred to the oxygen 

that abstracts the proton on tyrosine side chain to form the hydroxyl group. 
The role of aldehyde reductase tyrosine phenol group is to serve as a general acid 

to provide proton to the reduced aldehyde oxygen on glucose.
